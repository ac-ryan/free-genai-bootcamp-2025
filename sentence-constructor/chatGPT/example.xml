        - Bad: The table did not include the Japanese characters, the cells are blank
        - Bad: The first sentence is uncessary, should start with the vocabulary table
        - Bad: The clues shoudl not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
        - Bad: The sentance structure says too much. The structure should be conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible vocabulary list to get you started:

        |Japanese | Romaji  | English
        |         | kuma    |   bear |
        |         | tobira	|   door |
        |         | mottai	|   to leave something behind |
        |         | gomi	|   garbage |
        |         | soto	|   outside |
        
        Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "Did you leave the garbage out?" We'll need to use a conjunction to connect these two clauses.
        
        Here's a possible sentence structure:
        [Clause 1: Bears are at the door] + [Conjunction] + [Clause 2: Did you leave the garbage out?]
        Your turn! Can you try to assemble the sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
